                    Kudzu is an invasive vine that can harm Florida`s biodiversity by shading out native plants and animals. 
                    Kudzu is native to Japan and southeast China, but was introduced to the United States in 1876 as an ornamental plant. 
                    It can grow up to 100 feet long, and is found in Florida from north to central, with some reports in south Florida. 
                    Kudzu can thrive in hot summers and mild winters, and can overtake trees, telephone poles, and abandoned homes.
